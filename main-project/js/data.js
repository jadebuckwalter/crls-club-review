Massachusetts State Science Olympiad – This is a one-day event in March consisting of 25 events. Each student participates in 2-4 events. To prepare, students are paired with mentors who meet with them weekly beginning in late fall. MIT Science Trivia Competition - This team trivia competition is part of the Cambridge Science Festival and happens during April vacation. Teams of up to 5 students and 5 alternates compete against teams from other schools. *A note about the meeting time: Tuesdays is the regular day we check in as a team.
